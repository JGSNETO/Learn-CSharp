# Learn-C#

- C# is a modern, high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s. It was designed to be a simple, yet powerful language that can be used to develop a wide range of applications, including desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps, and games. 
- C# is based on .NET framework and provides features like garbage collection, type safety and automatic memory management.

## Features of C#

1. Type safety: Every variable and expression has a type. The compiler checks for type compatibility to prevent errors at runtime.
2. Garbage collection: C# uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation. This makes it easier to write memory-safe code and eliminates many common programming errors, such as memoy leaks.
3. Object-Oriented Programming: It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This makes it easier to write reusable and maintainable code. 
4. Plataform Independence: It can run on any plataform that supports the .NET framework, such as linux, windows and macOS.
5. Asynchronous programming: C# Supports asynchronous programming which allows developers to write non-blocking code that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. 
6. LINQ: Language Integrated Query, which is a powerful feature that allows developers to query data from different data sources such as databases, XML documents, and collections using a common syntax.
7. Delegates and Events: Allow developers to write event-driven code that responds to user actions, system events and other externam stimuli. 
8. Exception Handling:
9. Generic Programming:
10. Easy-to-learn syntax:
